# React Direct
Modern react application with useful patterns inside.

## Introduction

This is an attempt to create fully functional react app using modern approaches. The idea behind is to leverage old and battle tested concepts on the new ground.

## Features
Principles which drive this app are as follows:


##### 🎯 *Direct*
Embraces explicit and co-located code which is easy to delete and move from one place to another. The code is direct and specific as it can be. which is optimizing for change. No magic!
##### 🍆 *No classes*
Only functional components.
##### ❣️ *Hooks*
Uses hooks all the way (available as of react 16.7.0-alpha).
##### 🖖 *Code splitting*
Uses `React.lazy` and webpack behind the scene.
##### ⏱️ *Suspense*
React suspense for all things except data (code splitting, media loading).
##### 👗 *CSS-in-JS*
It's based on styled components for the look and feel.
##### 🤷 *Promote defaults*
As little configuration as possible. Uses defaults wherever it can.

## Modern libraries

It also uses modern libraries for core things:
- `Reach Router`
- `Styled Components` -> CSS in JS
- `React Spring` -> Animations
