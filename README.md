# react-modern
Modern react application with useful patterns inside.

## Introduction

This is an attempt to create fully functional react app using modern approaches. The idea behind is to leverage old and battle tested concepts on the new ground.

## Features
Principles which drives this app are as follows:

##### 🍆 *No classes*
Only functional components.
##### ❣️ *Hooks*
Uses hoos all the way down (available as of react 16.7.0-alpha).
##### 🖖 *Code splitting*
Uses `React.lazy` and webpack behind the scene.
##### ⏱️ *Suspense*
React suspense for all things except data (code splitting, media loading).
##### 👗 *CSS-in-JS*
It's based on styled components for the look and feel.
##### 🤷 *Promote defaults*
As little configuration as possible. Uses defaults wherever it can

## Modern libraries

It also uses modern libraries for core things:
- `Reach Router`
- `Styled Components` -> CSS in JS
- `React Spring` -> Animations
