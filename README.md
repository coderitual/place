# React Direct
Modern react application with useful patterns inside. The main purpose it to teach how to create real world application by solving real world problems. Other than that I want to learn myself by putting and organizing react knowledge into one applications which covers `routing`, `data fetching`, `animations & transitions`, `shared state` and a few more UI concepts. All these things will be grouped and described in the easy to follow way (TODO).

## Introduction

This is an attempt to create fully functional react app using modern approaches. The idea behind is to leverage old and battle tested concepts on the new ground.

## Features
Principles which drive this app are as follows:


##### 🎯 *Direct*
Embraces explicit and co-located code which is easy to delete and move from one place to another. This is an optimization for change as the change is the thing which will eventually happen. The code is direct and specific as it can be. No magic.
##### 🍆 *No classes*
Only functional components.
##### ❣️ *Hooks*
Uses hooks all the way (available as of react 16.7.0-alpha).
##### 🖖 *Code splitting*
Uses `React.lazy` and webpack behind the scene.
##### ⏱️ *Suspense*
React suspense for all things except data (code splitting, media loading).
##### 👗 *CSS-in-JS*
It's based on styled components for the look and feel.
##### 🤷 *Promote defaults*
As little configuration as possible. Uses defaults wherever it can.

## Modern libraries

It also uses modern libraries for core things:
- `Reach Router`
- `Styled Components` -> CSS in JS
- `React Spring` -> Animations
