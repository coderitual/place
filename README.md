# React Direct
Modern react application with useful patterns inside. The main purpose of it is to teach how to create real world application by solving real world problems. Other than that I want to learn myself by putting and organizing react knowledge into one application. It covers basic areas such as: `routing`, `data fetching`, `animations & transitions`, `shared state` and a few more UI concepts: `notifications`, `modals`, `navigation`, `themes`. All these topics are grouped into applicaion folders in the way which feels right to me but they are not carved in stone so they can change their place in future.

## Introduction

This is an attempt to create fully functional react app using modern approaches. The idea behind is to leverage old and battle tested concepts on the new ground.

## Features
Principles which drive this app are as follows:


##### 🎯 *Direct*
Embraces explicit and co-located code which is easy to delete and move from one place to another. This is an optimization for change as the change is the thing which will eventually happen. The code is direct and specific as it can be. No magic.
##### 🍆 *No classes*
Only functional components.
##### ❣️ *Hooks*
Uses hooks all the way (available as of react 16.7.0-alpha).
##### 🖖 *Code splitting*
Uses `React.lazy` along with `import()` and let the webpack do the job.
##### ⏱️ *Suspense*
React suspense for all things except data (code splitting, media loading).
##### 👗 *CSS-in-JS*
It's based on styled components for the look and feel.
##### 🤷 *Promote defaults*
As little configuration as possible. Uses defaults wherever it can.

## Modern libraries

Application uses modern libraries for the core things:
- `Reach Router`
- `Styled Components` -> CSS in JS
- `React Spring` -> Animations
